    The Pacific Northwest Programming Languages and Software Engineering
    (PNW PLSE) workshop provides an opportunity for programming languages
    and software engineering researchers throughout the Pacific Northwest to
    meet, interact, and share work in progress as well as recent results.
    Meetings will feature talks and demonstrations of current projects,
    provide opportunities to get feedback on exciting new projects, and
    generally foster connections that strengthen our vibrant research
    community in the region.
